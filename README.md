# Studio-2-project

Working with the sockets.io was a lot of intensive work.  I missed a class period and it really set me back.  I tried to figure out everything and catchup, but was unable to totally complete the project.  I will be taking time this summer to finish the project for my own knowledge.  Using wireshark to capture the traffic was really neat.  I look forward to divulging into more networking and server projects to increase my understanding of the process.
