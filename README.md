# Studio-2-project

Working with the sockets.io was a lot of intensive work.  I missed a class period and it really set me back.  I tried to figure out everything and catchup, but was unable to totally complete the project.

Learning to connect multiple computers on a server was a lot of fun.  The more I get into learning the syntax and coding of multiple languages will only help to make future projects easier.  Passing information on a server and being able to track that information helps to understand the process involved in applications and communication.

During our class, we had a lot of issues with some systems not downloading the node.js and also sometimes the server would not connect for no reason.
